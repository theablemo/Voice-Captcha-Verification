Voice Captcha Verification
==========================

This project was a part of the Pezhvaak startup, co-founded by [Dr. Amir Najafi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=N_zYPC0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Abolfazl Motahari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJ-biB0AAAAJ&hl=en). In this project, 3 words are shown to the user and to verify that a humen-operator is using the system, the user should speak the words.
This app uses two methods for speech-to-text, one is with a BERT model, developed by the Pezhvaak team, and one with the aligner developed by Google.
